At first, I receive bluetooth usb and Wii Remote from professor. The Wii Remote can connect to Raspberry Pi by bluetooth device. I setup the bluetooth on Raspberry Pi by plug it into the usb slot and install bluetooth package by this command line “sudo apt-get install –no-install-recommends bluetooth”. When the bluetooth package already installed in the Raspberry Pi, I can check the bluetooth status by type “sudo service bluetooth status” in command line. If bluetooth is working the terminal will show message “bluetooth is running”.\nTo detect Wii remote on Raspberry Pi I have to type “hcitool scan” if Wii Remote was found it will show a message like “00:1E:02:8A:CD:A1 Nintendo RVL-CNT-01” on the screen. Before using Wii remote with raspberry pi I have to install CWIID MODULE by type “sudo apt-get install python-cwiid” and we have test its with the sample code on Raspberry Pi website.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/samplecode.jpg\" alt=\"sample code\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<p>For the last, I have to write the program in C &amp; Python to control the robotics with Wiimote. The program will check the setupGPIO and then print the message to wait for a connection from Wiimote. If the connection succeeds the Wiimote will rumble and show the usage buttons message but during connection time out the program will quit. When Wiimote has connected successfully if the home button was pressed the program will start and the program will check buttons to control the directional movement of the robotic car. The program will work until the home button was pressed again.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/roboticcar.jpg\" alt=\"robotic car\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<p>The program show Wiimote is connected and how to use</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/startwiimote.jpg\" alt=\"wii mote\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" /></p>\n\n<p>You can use buttons or gyroscope to command the robot.
